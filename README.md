# Uniformity.jl
A WIP trying to achieve something similar to [trustfall](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall)
but for the Julia REPL. Still trying to work out the interface and useful
features so any suggestions are welcome.

Currently, I'm implementing my own sources in [UniformityCollection.jl](https://github.com/fivegrant/UniformityCollection.jl)
